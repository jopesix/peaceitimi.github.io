# Peace Itimi

I build at the intersection of marketing, media, and technology. For almost a decade, I worked inside early and growth-stage companies, leading growth before becoming a founder.

## About
My career started far from tech. I studied medical biochemistry and genetics before finding my way into digital marketing and the startup ecosystem. Straight out of university, I co-founded Rene Digital Hub with a friend. We built a digital marketing agency working with businesses across education, sports betting and consumer products. We learned to find customers, price work, deliver results, and fix mistakes quickly. We scaled that business to 6 figures in revenue within 2 years before shutting it down to pursue other interests. 
Over the years that followed, I have led growth and go-to-market for startups across Africa, Europe, and North America. At Africhange, a bootstrapped remittance company headquartered in Canada, I built the growth playbook from the ground up and helped scale the business to hundreds of thousands of users and billions in transaction volume. At Smile ID, a Series B digital identity company operating across Africa, I led marketing and strategy through a repositioning and expansion period, building a consistent enterprise pipeline and supporting revenue growth; during my time, identities verified grew by 233% over two years. At Seedstars, a global entrepreneurship platform running programmes across dozens of cities, I led global growth across multiple regions, building acquisition and lifecycle systems that had to work across very different markets.
Alongside full-time roles, I have also consulted and worked as a fractional CMO for 10+ pre-seed to Series A startups. I have trained founders, creatives and operators through programmes such as Google Digital Skills, Facebook for Creators, & Digital Marketing Institute.
Beyond these operating roles, I started the Founders Connect Show to document the stories of Black and African builders globally. I noticed a gap in how these stories were told; too often, they were reduced to headlines in mainstream media or reserved for a select few, without context or depth. 
What began as a YouTube series and grew into a media and events platform, with long-form interviews, live events across the UK, Canada, Kenya, the US, and Nigeria, and an online community that continues to grow.
Today, I am building rivva. It is an intelligent assistant for knowledge workers designed to reduce cognitive load by helping people plan work in sync with their energy, not just their availability. The idea comes from years of watching capable people lose momentum, not because they lack ability, but because the daily effort of planning and re-planning quietly drains focus and follow-through.

## rivva
The problem: Knowledge workers are overloaded. Every day, they jump between Slack, email, meetings, and task tools, losing hours to coordination, context switching, and deciding what to do next. Most productivity tools optimise for time, not capacity, assuming people can work at full speed all day. Yet our cognitive energy fluctuates, and without systems that adapt to it or account for personal context, performance drops and burnout rises. The result is wasted time and declining output, costing companies millions in lost productivity and the global economy over $1 trillion each year.

The solution: rivva is an intelligent assistant that unifies tasks, email, and scheduling in one workspace. It connects to users’ calendars, inboxes, and other tools to surface priorities and automatically plan the day. Using sleep and energy data, it aligns deep and light work with each person’s natural rhythm. The system adapts in real time as meetings shift or new tasks appear, keeping everything in sync. 


My Thesis 
The next frontier of workplace performance is cognitive capacity; our ability to think clearly, make sound decisions, and sustain focus under increasing complexity.  As AI takes over more manual and routine work, human performance will depend less on technical skill and more on the quality of our thinking. Yet most tools still treat productivity as a time problem, ignoring how focus, energy, and overload shape strategy and execution.
The next generation of productivity systems must therefore understand how people actually function, integrating biological, behavioural, and work data to manage energy and focus intelligently. More than 400 million wearables now track sleep, stress, and recovery, but these insights remain disconnected from how work is performed. The opportunity is to connect these signals to how work is orchestrated, giving individuals and teams the systems to protect and extend their cognitive capacity. Rivva exists to connect these worlds, merging context from work tools with signals from the body, and to build the foundation for sustainable, high-performance work.

## Personal
I am based in London, UK.
Outside work, I like to go on long walks to nowhere, I read a lot of romance novels and non-fiction (self-help) and watch far too many medical, legal, and emergency dramas. I love teaching and listening to people's stories. My faith matters to me; God is my anchor.
I hold an MBA from Imperial College Business School. I returned to academia because I missed structured learning, wanted to expand my network, and was looking for a degree that offered a broad grounding across organisational behaviour, economics, finance, and strategy.
My biggest strengths are hard work and resilience. I work hard, I show up, and no matter how tough things get, I never ever stop trying.
I sometimes moonlight as an angel investor. Through HoaQ, Future Africa & the Hustle Fund, and directly, I invested in Lemfi, Raenest, Eden Life, Norebase, Chowdeck, Harriet Osen, Paga, Kunda Kids, Klump, Payhippo, cocreate.ink, pngme, and more.
